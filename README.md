# Three-Dimensional-Packing-Problem

## Purpose
Finding out the max potential of Bin Fill Rate at a warehouse by assuming the right products will be placed into their best fit locations. 

## Objectives
(1) Maximize Bin Fill Rate at a warehouse Level \
(2) Maximize Bin Fill Rate a each rack dimension Level \
(3) Minimize # of units per location (f) \

## Constraints
(1) Max # of units per location (f_max) = 12 \
(2) No product mix in one location, one location can only have one dimension of product \

## Assumptions
(1) # of location counts per each rack dimension is limited based on warehouse configuration \
(2) # of product units is limited based on actual inventory on hand \
(3) a product cannot be taken out once the placement is done \

## Method
